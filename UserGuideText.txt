					Story
	The original purpose of the Dungeon has been lost to time, as it's structure is no longer
	static. The ever-shifting walls betray the dark energies that linger through the stone.
	While their reasons are never the same, adventurers continue to funnel into the disguised
	death trap that is the Dungeon.
	After realizing the terror that could come from the accursed depths of the Dungeon, nearby
	towns began to raise bounties for it's destruction, unaware of the true curse the Dungeon 
	hosts. This led to the Dungeon growing in power and numbers in a drastic amount of time.
	You, the Player, are one of these many adventurers, and while your reason is your own,
	your goal is the same. 
				   Destroy the dungeon.

					Characters

		**The Player**
		| HP: 50 | ATK: 2 | DEF: 2 |
		The Player is the hero of Dungeon Crawl.

		**Skeleton**
		| HP: Variable | ATK: Variable | DEF: Variable |
		The Skeletons are slaves of the Dungeon's master, the Lich.
		They show no high-level intelligence, and seek the destruction of all who oppose
		their master.

		**The Master**
		| HP: ?? | ATK: ?? | DEF: ?? |
		The Dungeon's master is a mystery to all, as none who enter can speak
		of it's true nature. It's rumored that the curse stems from this creature,
		but others theorise they are a victim of a bigger threat.

===================================================================================================

					Environment
		**Floor**
		The Floor is a mundane piece of environment, as it has no special features.
		It allows passage to any creature, and can contain loot.
		The terrain contains a latent dark energy that becomes more 

		**Wall**
		The Wall blocks any movement of any creature that would intersect with it.
		It will never contain loot.

		**Door**
		The Door is mechanically similar to the Floor, in that it has no mechanical purpose.
		It will open when a creature walks into it.

		**Gold**
		The primary currency of the land, the Gold is the lifeblood of creatures in the Dungeon.
		As a conductor of necromantic magics, Gold can be found in the systems of the undead,
		similar to the blood in the living.
		Upon death, undead powered by Gold will dissipate, leaving the coagulated solid Gold
		that once ran through their veins.
		The Player can collect Gold for score.

		**Chest**
		The primary means of storing loot collected from adventurers foolish enough to enter
		the Dungeon, Chests contain useful items and equipment that the Player can obtain for
		later use, such as armor and potions.

		**Stairs**
		The Stairs act as a means to traverse the many floors of the Dungeon for it's inhabitants.
		For the Player, they serve as a direct route all the way down to the Dungeon's master.

					Equipment
			=== Weapons ===
			
			**Dagger**
			| ATK: 6 | DEF: 0 | 
			The Dagger is standard-issue for those who enter the Dungeon.
			Considered useless, the undead in the Dungeon constantly discard
			these blades at the entrance, however they still hold a fraction of
			the Dungeon's power, making them stronger than their regular counterparts.

			**Sword**
			| ATK: 10 | DEF: 0 |
			The Sword is the next upgrade most adventurers seek in the Dungeon.
			Charged with more energy than the Dagger due to how long it spends
			in the Dungeon.

			**Great Axe**
			| ATK: 14 | DEF: 0 |
			The Great Axe is a well-refined weapon, and one of the realm's favorites.
			Rarely, an adventurer spews forth from the dungeon, crazed and wielding
			one of these blades, allowing them to circulate through the realm as relics.

			**Great Hammer**
			| ATK: 18 | DEF: 0 |

			**Bladestorm**
			| ATK: ?? | DEF: 0 | CURSED |
			A too-perfect confluence of workmanship and magic, the Bladestorm relic is
			a weapon that not just a double-edged blade in metaphor. Known only in myths,
			tales and rumor, the warning is always the same: The blade unlocks something
			in humanity that should never be discovered.

			**The Last Light's Hand**
			| ATK: ?? | DEF: 0 |
			Legends speak of a guild of Paladins, those trained in the art of prayer and blade.
			These Paladins were commonly contracted in realms of high undead concentration,
			to destroy the sources of evil that once corrupted the lands.
			As the realm got safer, their numbers dwindled, their intake sputtered, and their
			members retired, leaving the guild as a legend. However, myths circulated that their
			equipment would never retired, forever pulsing with the power of forgotten Gods.

			=== Armor ===

			**Cloth Armor**
			| ATK: 0 | DEF: 1 |
			Your own simple clothes, left uncursed by the Dungeon's magic.
			Surprisingly stain-resistant.

			**Leather Armor**
			| ATK: 0 | DEF: 5 |

			**Bronze Armor**
			| ATK: 0 | DEF: 9 |

			**Steel Armor**
			| ATK: 0 | DEF: 12 |

			**Ocean's Defense**
			| ATK: 0 | DEF: ?? | CURSED |

			**The Last Light's Guide**
			| ATK: 0 | DEF: ?? |
			It is common in the realm for snake oil merchants to contract blacksmiths to make
			Paladin armor replicas to pawn them off as the real-deal, an actual relic, for
			extreme amounts of money. Being made of weaker materials than proper armor,
			it is common to find important soldiers and wealthy mercenaries dead in these
			replicas, as the true art of Godsmithing is isolated to the crazed and fanatic alike.

			=== Shields ===

			**Empty Hand**
			| ATK: 0 | DEF: 0 |

			**Wooden Shield**
			| ATK: 0 | DEF: 1 |

			**Bronze Shield**
			| ATK: 0 | DEF: 3 |

			**Steel Shield**
			| ATK: 0 | DEF: 9 |

			**The Last Light's Guard**
			| ATK: 0 | DEF: ?? |
			A certain legend details one mythical Paladin, a master of not only blade and prayer,
			but also of defense, hints at the possibility that there was perhaps a higher echelon
			of Paladins in the guild.
