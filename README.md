# Dungeon Crawl
*A Greenfoot-coded game.*
------


## Purpose
This game intends to show the capabilities of Greenfoot in terms of creating a randomly-generated, stat-based RPG with items and equipment. It is by no means complete, and is an ongoing project, but is currently playable.


## Can I fork the repository to make my own game?
Yes, but only if the game you create is also completely free. I created this as a simple project, and would appreciate if you respected the license.
 
 
 ## I found a bug in your game. Where should I report it?
 It's advised to utilise the bug-report template in the Issues tab to report bugs. If an issue is closed, but the bug remains, make sure to check if it was fixed on the dev branch before requesting the issue be reopened.
 
 
 ## I think the game would do better with [feature], what should I do?
 The issues tab also doubles as a suggestion tab, but you should utilise the suggestion template when doing so. Not all suggestions will be accepted, however.
